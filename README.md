# Speech-Recognition-Code
This project uses Python libraries speech_recognition for converting speech to text, pyttsx3 for offline text-to-speech, and webbrowser to open websites based on voice commands. It listens via mic, processes the input, and either repeats it or opens the spoken website. Error handling is included for unrecognized speech.
